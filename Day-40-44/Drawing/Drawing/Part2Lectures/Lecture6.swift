//                    .strokeBorder(self.color(for: value, brightness: 1), lineWidth: 2)
//                but if we replace strokeBorder with the below code it might cause problems in frame
                    .strokeBorder(LinearGradient(gradient: Gradient(colors: [
                        self.color(for: value, brightness: 1),

// We can fix this by applying one new modifier, called drawingGroup(). This tells SwiftUI it should render the contents of the view into an off-screen image before putting it back onto the screen as a single rendered output, which is signficantly faster. Behind the scenes this is powered by Metal, which is Appleâ€™s framework for working directly with the GPU for extremely fast graphics.

        .drawingGroup()
//        The drawingGroup() modifier is helpful to know about and to keep in your arsenal as a way to solve performance problems when you hit them, but you should not use it that often. Adding the off-screen render pass might slow down SwiftUI for simple drawing, so you should wait until you have an actual performance problem before trying to bring in drawingGroup().
